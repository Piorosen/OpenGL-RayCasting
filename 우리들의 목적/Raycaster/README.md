A simple raycaster, written in C++.
Learned a lot from about the algorithm [here](http://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html).

I wrote this a while back, just keeping it around for archival purposes. It was the first "working" raycaster I made.
Texture support is broken, if you want a better example check out [Rustcaster](https://github.com/Dooskington/Rustcaster).
